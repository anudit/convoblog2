If you're reading this, then you too had the opportunity of taking birth twice. First in the world and then on the World Wide Web.

Our humble introduction to the real world as infants started with a fair amount of anonymity. However, as we further ventured we were given a name. This gesture of naming was to Facilitate a more intricate function of the world.

As we understood the world, those around us also made their attempts at understanding us. And this process of cohesive understanding was where we developed an identity. Name being amongst the most primary identifier. Our characteristics could be tied to something easy to use and constant throughout life.

Our journey wasn't much different on internet.however, our uniqueness and individuality wasn't tied to a name but to an email ID.

But...
There is a major not so understandable difference. If email ID is in fact the basis for all our online life, how can it be so disjointed from reality?
That is, one may

- have multiple email IDs.
- use any name to create email.
- use a random date of birth or age.
- pick any location as their birthplace and living place

Basically, the online world relies on the user to be honest. As a result of which we suffered from ---------- scams, ---------- ID hacks and ---------- cyber bullying.

The users of Internet are real world people who suffer very real consequences. So what are we doing to ensure that the information that is online is also real?

“The Internet was built without an identity layer. *The Internet was built without a way to know who and what you are connecting to. This limits what we can do with it and exposes us to growing dangers. If we do nothing, we will face rapidly proliferating episodes of theft and deception that will cumulatively erode public trust in the Internet.*”

—Kim Cameron, Microsoft Chief Identity Architect, The Laws of Identity.

Imagine having a system through which every user can guarantee their safety. Or as Kim Cameron said an identity layer.

The Internet wasn't built for people to be citizens of it but we are the citizens of the online world. Every article we read, every photo we see. In fact, everything online comes from a person. And today, when it has become so difficult to decipher the difference between real and fake, what are we doing to ensure that what one uploads online is respectable and honest?

The answer to that lies in the real world.

When doing a mischief as kids the only thing we were worried about was being caught. Every time we were about to do something notorious, we checked the gallery and locked our rooms to avoid scrutiny/Scolding.

This fear of being held accountable for mischief. Did in fact stop us from doing things that could have unwillingly harmed us or others.

And in fact, one of the strongest ways to avoid digital crimes is having one identity to which actions can be tied.

## The world we all share

The constitution of a country might give its citizen the freedom to express but the internet has provided us with platforms to be heard and seen like never before.

However, in recent times this power has been misused to pedal fake news hate and violence.

 When such incidents happen it is mostly the sites that get blamed. And the source of such fake information i.e. the individual who creates and uploads walks away thanks to the ability to create a random email id and a profile that aren’t sufficient to trace back to the real person.

The question of identity layer on internet is not of why but when?

As we advance into the future it is highly unlikely that our dependence on internet will reduce. The internet will have to be a more trustworthy environment as a whole.

When one switches websites the username or the content uploaded on it might change but the person behind them remains the same.

The internet identity system will have to be a true exclusive and unique identifier of the person. A sort of bridge between real life and internet.

This will be a sure shot way of eliminating bots and fake accounts as they will have no real life proof to tie back to.
