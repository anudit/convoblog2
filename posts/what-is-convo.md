Now that you have gathered the will to read this blog post, let me tell you a good news that I am not a developer/coder for the convo space. I’ve done more brain work on Convo so you can be sure that nothing in this post is going to be technical and/or boring.

Allow me to take you through the journey that has brought us to the cusp of a social media revolution.

During a very lame everyday conversation about politics and life in general my friend (the real deal aka Anudit) and I hit a wall. Although, we were approximately 500 kms apart the wall we hit was actually the same.

While trying to talk to each other about articles and pictures on some random topic (to rant mostly) we felt imprisoned by the platform that we were using to text.

We had to get out of the texting app to go to the article, share the link  and then revisit the Web page to talk about the specifics of the post. As if COVID-19 restrictions weren’t enough there we were feeling exasperated because of Web2 bars.

I’m sorry, I know that was a bit technical but here is the thing. Almost all of the social platforms that we currently use (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Email, Telegram, WhatsApp etc.) run in the Web2 world.

These platforms restrict our behavior to their ecosystem. Let us say if you were on a blogging website, your interaction with the content and/or the creator would be limited by the design/features of the website.

The internet as it is might not seem full of hurdles because we have essentially found our way around most hurdles and these patterns have become a part of our life.

However, as internet continues to grow and new and better platforms start to emerge, the walled gardens of social media giants and Web2 in general seem to have imprisoned us.

We stick to the platform that most of our friends use, even though we know of better platforms.

This not just stops us from exploring, but also acts as a discouragement for a new app or startup or creator.

We at Convo focus on making internet more possible, both for a user and creator.

Imagine Convo as a thread that runs through out the internet, that binds together all the platforms irrespective of whichever one you use. Moreover, we give people the opportunity to not just interact in real-time with any content but also interact across platform just by holding the thread.

We call this thread ‘UCI’ (United Conversations Interface).
We use the decentralized networking system of Web3 to make it completely secure, private and customizable for both the user and the creator.

Here is a use-case of convo just to make things absolutely clear.

Let’s take an ’NFT’ (Non Fungible Tokens) platform which has thousands of NFTs. All that a user does on the platform is “scroll-scroll-scroll” unless they find something that catches the eye.

What may catch my eye might be very different from what someone else likes. However, the NFTs are valuable only if they carry a shared value. If, there is no way for people to react and/or talk about the NFT or learn from the creator the story behind the piece, how is anyone to derive any value. In such cases Convo acts as a voice, as well as a feedback system for the NFT creator, seller, buyer and the website/platform.

To ease things a little further, understand how it is when you go out on a walk with your friends. How easy is it just to point at things and talk about them. This is exactly what we are doing with Convo, we bring alive a more human experience on the internet. See anything online and just talk about it then and there with your friends, the creator or the global community of netizens.

What the use of blockchain adds to Convo is the ability for anyone and everyone to carry with them, their reputation and the work that they want to showcase as a part of their identity. Moreover, inheriting security from a blockchain totally denunciates the need for a central authority that could control or censor any users' data.

Convo is not just the future of conversations but also the stepping stone towards a more 'Inclusive' and 'Possible' Internet.
